# 👋 Hey, I’m **Dheeraj Mekala**

**AI Engineer · Data Scientist · Independent AI Researcher**
*Building practical, privacy-aware AI systems.*

## What I Do

- 🚀 Build RAG systems & multi-agent frameworks (LangGraph, LangChain, FastAPI, Azure AI) to automate workflows in enterprise, healthcare, and industrial settings.

- 🧠 Research on Relational Deep Learning (RDL) & Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) — designing relational pipelines that preserve multi-table structure.

- 📊 Engineer data pipelines & warehouses (Snowflake, Databricks, Power BI, SQL) with real-world analytics applications.

- 🔒 Explore AI privacy, data governance, and secure deployment strategies (hybrid LLMs, anonymization, vector DB encryption).

- 🛠️ Develop tools around auth APIs (Gmail, Microsoft Graph) and automation systems for email, job applications, and document processing.

## Current Interests

- Designing enterprise-ready RAG prototypes and multi-agent systems.

- Scaling GNN models in production with graph DBs & partitioned inference.

- Exploring IoT + AI as the next convergence point of my Mechatronics & AI skillset.

- Writing beginner-friendly papers on RAG, ReAct, privacy, and AI adoption.
